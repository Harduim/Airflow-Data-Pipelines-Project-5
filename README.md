# Airflow Data Pipelines with Redshift and S3 | Udacity Project 05 

A music fictional streaming company, **Sparkify**, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines.

The data pipelines should be dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## Project Datasets

### Song Dataset 

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). 
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.

#### s3://udacity-dend/song_data

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

#### s3://udacity-dend/log_data

## Code style

### Formatting 
#### Using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) with line lengh set to 100 `black -l 100 script.py`

#### Imports organized with [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) with line lengh set to 100 `isort -l 100 script.py `

## Schema

Using the star schema because the main focus is analytics.

- **songplays**: Main table, where the song plays are stored
- **users**: Data about the users
- **time**: Timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
- **artists**: Artists available in the platform 
- **songs**: Songs catalog

## Setting up the environment:

### Requirements:
- An active Amazon AWS Account
- An active S3 Bucket
- Anaconda
- Ubuntu
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Conda
- Navigate to the project folder
- Create the environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- Activate the new environment: `conda activate airflow_udacity`

### Configuration
- Create the tables on Redshift using the **create_tables.sql**  [query editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/redshift/latest/mgmt/query-editor.html)
- Create a new config file named **environment.sh** using the template config file **environment.sh.template**
- Fill the env variables in **environment.sh** according to your environment.
- Load the environment variables `source environment.sh`
- Create the MySQL container `docker-compose up`
- Activate the conda environment: `conda activate airflow_udacity`
- Install airflow 1.10.14 (At the time of writting 2.0 was just released)
  - Check the oficial Airflow docs: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation.html#getting-airflow
```shell
AIRFLOW_VERSION=1.10.14
PYTHON_VERSION="$(python --version | cut -d " " -f 2 | cut -d "." -f 1-2)"

pip install "apache-airflow==${AIRFLOW_VERSION}" --constraint "${CONSTRAINT_URL}"

pip install apache-airflow["mysql"]
pip install apache-airflow["s3"]

airflow db init
```
